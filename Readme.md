# WebAssembly Tutorial

This tutorial aims to teach how WebAssembly works by using a WebAssembly module
written in Rust without binding generators. The interface is defined by
[wasm-bindgen][wasm-bindgen] and the auto generated wrapper serves as the
reference.

Files:

- [`index.html`](index.html): the set of exercises. Open the file in a recent
  WebBrowser, open the JavaScript console and follow the instructions. The idea
  is to implement the solutions in the file itself 
- [`solution/solution.html`](solution/solution.html): the same file with
  potential solutions for the different tasks. It aims to be as simple as
  possible and does not address error translation or optimizations. See the
  [`wasm-bindgen` generated wrapper](solution/wasm_bindgen_wrapper.js) for a
  robust implementation
- [`solution/wasm_bindgen_wrapper.js`](solution/wasm_bindgen_wrapper.js): the
  wrapper generated by [wasm-pack][wasm-pack] and [wasm-bindgen][wasm-bindgen],
  the reference implementation
- [`src/lib.rs`](src/lib.rs): the Rust module that defines the objects being
  wrapped

Implementation:

- [`build.py`](build.py): a build script to compile the WebAssemly module and
  then assemble the html files
- [`module.js`](module.js): the WebAssembly module as an inline string to not
  require a local web server
- [`tasks/*`](tasks): the input task / solution files

## Current status

At the moment the following topics are covered:

- calling functions with arguments that map to the WebAssembly types (`int32`,
  `int64`, `float32`, `float64`)
- creating objects living in WebAssembly and calling their methods
- passing strings and buffers to WebAssembly
- receiving strings and buffers from WebAssembly

The following points are still to be addressed:

- passing references of JavaScript objects to WebAssembly
- accessing properties of the JavaScript objects from WebAssembly
- passing JavaScript callbacks to WebAssembly

## Notes

- WebAssembly supports functions with multiple arguments and a single return
  value
- Supported types are 32 bit integers and floats and 64 bit integers and floats
- Other types need to be serialized and deserialized across WebAssembly <-> host
  boundary
- Memory is represented as a continuous array that is indexed by 32 bit unsigned
  integers
- Pointers are represented by such indices
